//! This module contains various useful pattern matching algorithms.
//! The implementations are based on the lecture notes
//! "Algorithmen auf Sequenzen", Kopczynski, Marschall, Martin and Rahmann, 2008 - 2015.
//!
//! * Algorithm of Horspool: fastest for a sufficiently large alphabet
//! * Shift And algorithm: fast for patterns with less than 64 symbols and very small alphabets.
//! * BNDM algorithm: fast for patterns with less than 64 symbols.
//! * BOM algorithm: fast for long patterns and small alphabet.
//! * KMP algorithm: the classical ancestor.
//! * Ukkonens algorithm: approximate pattern matching with dynamic programming.
//! * Myers algorithm: linear-time approximate pattern matching with edit distance for small patterns
//!
//! Another library that provides heavily optimized routines for string search primitives is memchr: https://crates.io/crates/memchr
